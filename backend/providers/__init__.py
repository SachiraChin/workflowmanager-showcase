"""
Providers Package - Shared provider implementations.

This package contains provider implementations that can be used by both
the server and worker processes. Providers have no knowledge of the
server or worker - they are pure implementations of external service
integrations.

Subpackages:
    media: Media generation providers (Leonardo, MidJourney, etc.)
