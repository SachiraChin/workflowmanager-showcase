# IMAGE ANALYSIS FOR PET VIDEO PRODUCTION

Analyze the provided image to extract environment details, motion elements, and
audio atmosphere for a pet related video production.

## PART 1: ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS

Extract scene details for narrative and caption generation.

**Identify:**
- Setting: Brief, specific description of the scene
- Time of day: dawn, morning, noon, afternoon, dusk, night
- Weather: If visible or implied (sunny, cloudy, rain, etc.)
- Location type: indoor, outdoor, specific venue type
- Key subjects: 3-6 main elements visible (include the pet!)
- Dominant colors: 3-5 colors defining the palette
- Atmosphere: The mood conveyed by the visuals
- Lighting: How light behaves in the scene

**Rules:**
- Only describe what is VISIBLE
- Be specific (e.g., "sunny living room with large windows" not "indoor")
- For key_subjects, prioritize the pet and their immediate environment

## PART 2: MOTION ELEMENT ANALYSIS

Identify elements for subtle animation suitable for short pet videos.

**Look for:**
- Light effects (sunbeams, lamp glow, reflections)
- Particles (dust motes, floating fur/hair)
- Fabric (pet bed, blankets, curtains)
- Environmental (plants swaying, water in bowl)
- Pet-adjacent elements (toys, food bowl steam)

**Constraints:**
- The PET must remain STATIC - do not suggest animating the pet itself
- Camera must remain STATIC - no zoom, pan, or movement
- Focus on SUBTLE, LOOPING motion suitable for 5-10 second clips
- Only identify elements CLEARLY VISIBLE in the image

**detected_elements (3-8 items):**
Best candidates for animation. For each provide:
- element: What could be animated
- motion_type: Type of motion (e.g., "gentle sway", "shimmer")
- location: Where in the frame

**all_potential_elements (5-20 items):**
Complete list of everything that COULD move (for negative prompts).
Include detected elements plus any others that might drift unintentionally.

## PART 3: AUDIO ATMOSPHERE ANALYSIS

Analyze for music generation context. This data will be used by the music
generation step to create appropriate background music.

**Identify:**
- implied_sounds: 2-5 sounds the scene suggests
- silence_level: very quiet / quiet / moderate / busy / loud
- emotional_intensity: serene / calm / neutral / tense / dramatic / intense
- temporal_feel: frozen/still / slow/meditative / gentle/flowing / moderate
- warmth: cold/clinical / cool / neutral / warm / very warm/intimate
- era_feel: Time period evoked (e.g., "cozy modern home")
- cultural_context: Geographic/cultural context if apparent
- suggested_music_genres: 2-3 genres that would complement
- musical_texture: Suggested texture (e.g., "warm and gentle")
