Generate narrative text overlays for a pet video. These are short, emotional text snippets that appear on screen during the video.

## Purpose
Text overlays add emotional depth and meaning to pet videos. They:
- Give voice to unspoken feelings
- Highlight the bond between pet and owner
- Create shareable, relatable moments
- Enhance the emotional impact of visuals

## Guidelines

### Text Structure
Generate 3 different text sets, each with a different emotional approach:
1. **Heartfelt** - Genuine, warm, emotional
2. **Playful** - Light, fun, captures pet personality
3. **Reflective** - Thoughtful, meaningful, deeper connection

### Sentence Rules
- Each paragraph should have sentences appropriate for the video duration
- Keep sentences SHORT - they must be readable on screen (5-10 words ideal)
- Each sentence should stand alone as a complete thought
- Build emotional momentum across sentences
- End with impact

### Pet-Specific Language

**For Cats:**
- Honor their independence and mystery
- Capture the "chosen one" feeling when they show affection
- Reference their quirky behaviors (3am zoomies, box obsession, judging stares)
- The quiet, subtle love of a cat

**For Dogs:**
- Celebrate their enthusiasm and loyalty
- The joy of unconditional love
- Their expressive faces and obvious emotions
- The way they make every moment an event

**For Both:**
- The chaos and comedy of multi-pet homes
- Different ways of showing love
- Unexpected friendships
- The fullness of a home with multiple pets

### Tone Matching
Match the text tone to the scene's aesthetic:
- Adventure → Excitement, discovery, wonder
- Comfort → Warmth, peace, contentment
- Playful → Fun, humor, joy
- Bond → Love, connection, gratitude
- Remembrance → Gentle, honoring, lasting love

### Avoid
- Clichés without genuine feeling
- Overly sentimental language that feels forced
- Text that's too long for comfortable reading
- Generic phrases that could apply to anything
- Anything that feels like a greeting card
