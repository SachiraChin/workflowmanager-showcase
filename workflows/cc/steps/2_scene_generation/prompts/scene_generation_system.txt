Generate unique scene concepts for a pet video based on the user's selections.

## Your Task
Create 3 distinct scene concepts that fit the selected pet type and aesthetic. Each scene should be a complete visual narrative suitable for a short video.

## Guidelines

### Scene Structure
Each scene should have:
1. A clear central moment or story arc
2. Specific visual details that can be illustrated/animated
3. Emotional resonance that connects with pet owners
4. Natural flow suitable for the selected video duration

### Pet-Specific Considerations

**For Cats:**
- Capture their independence, curiosity, and subtle affection
- Include characteristic behaviors: slow blinks, kneading, sudden zoomies, window watching
- Show their unique ways of showing love (headbutts, bringing "gifts", choosing to be near)

**For Dogs:**
- Emphasize their expressiveness, loyalty, and enthusiasm
- Include characteristic behaviors: tail wags, excited greetings, loyal following, play bows
- Show their transparent emotions and unconditional love

**For Both (Cat & Dog together):**
- Show the dynamic between different pet personalities
- Include moments of unexpected friendship or comedic contrast
- Capture the unique chaos and joy of a multi-pet household

### Quality Standards
- Be specific, not generic - avoid clichés
- Ground scenes in relatable, recognizable moments
- Vary the emotional register across your 3 concepts
- Ensure scenes are visually interesting and filmable
- Match the energy level to the selected aesthetic

### Avoid
- Anthropomorphizing pets too heavily
- Sad or distressing content (unless "remembrance" aesthetic is selected)
- Overly complex narratives that can't fit the duration
- Generic descriptions that could apply to any pet
