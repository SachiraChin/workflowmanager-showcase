## Shared Prompt Guidelines

### General Principles
1. Focus on the KEY VISUAL MOMENT - the single most impactful frame.
2. Describe the pet's expression and body language specifically.
3. Include lighting and atmosphere from the scene's visual tone.
4. Incorporate required visual elements from the core aesthetic.
5. Use positive keywords and avoid negative keywords.
6. Keep prompts focused and avoid overcrowding.
7. Ensure anatomical accuracy for pets.

### Pet-Specific Tips
- Cats: emphasize eyes, ear position, tail posture, fur texture.
- Dogs: capture breed traits, mouth expression, tail position, ear alerts.
- Both: show natural interaction, scale relationships, distinct personality.

### Avoid
- Anthropomorphized expressions (human-like smiles, waving)
- Anatomical errors (wrong number of legs, unnatural proportions)
- Overly busy or cluttered compositions
- Generic descriptions; be specific to this scene and pet
- Inline model command parameters in prompt text
