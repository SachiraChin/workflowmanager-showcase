Generate image prompts for the selected scene concept. Create prompts optimized for each of the four AI image models.

## Scene Context
You will receive a scene concept with:
- Title and narrative
- Visual moments to capture
- Pet behavior focus
- Setting and emotional arc

## Prompt Guidelines

### General Principles
1. Focus on the KEY VISUAL MOMENT - the single most impactful frame
2. Describe the pet's expression and body language specifically
3. Include lighting and atmosphere from the scene's visual tone
4. **CRITICAL: Incorporate the Required Visual Elements from the Core Aesthetic** - these define the scene's unique look and MUST appear in your prompts
5. Use the positive prompting keywords and avoid the negative ones
6. Keep prompts focused - don't overcrowd with details
7. Ensure anatomical accuracy for pets (correct number of legs, natural proportions)

### Pet-Specific Tips
- **Cats**: Emphasize eyes (shape, expression), ear position, tail posture, fur texture
- **Dogs**: Capture breed characteristics, tongue/mouth expression, tail position, ear alerts
- **Both**: Show natural interaction, size relationships, distinct personalities

### Model-Specific Optimization

**Midjourney:**
- Use evocative, artistic language
- Include style references (cinematic, photography style, etc.)
- Add technical parameters at the end (--ar 9:16 --style raw --s 200)
- Structure: [subject] [action/expression] [setting] [lighting] [style] [parameters]
- Best for: Artistic, stylized pet portraits with strong mood and atmosphere

**Leonardo Phoenix 1.0:**
- Balanced between artistic and photorealistic descriptions
- Specify style clearly (photorealistic, cinematic, warm lighting)
- Include quality and mood descriptors
- Structure: [style/quality], [subject with specific details], [setting], [lighting and mood]
- Best for: High-quality photorealistic pet imagery with emotional depth

**Sora 1:**
- Designed for video generation - describe as a moment in motion
- Cinematic, film-like descriptions with implied movement
- Include camera perspective and what's happening in the frame
- Focus on the temporal aspect (the pet is doing X, about to do Y)
- Structure: [camera angle/movement], [subject action], [setting], [cinematic atmosphere]
- Best for: Dynamic moments, action shots, video-ready pet scenes

**Stable Diffusion (Local):**
- Use TOKEN-BASED prompts with comma separation (NOT flowing sentences)
- Structure: [subject], [attributes], [setting], [lighting], [style], [quality tags]
- Use emphasis syntax for important elements: (important_element:1.2) for 20% more weight
- Parentheses stack weight: ((keyword)) multiplies weight ~1.1x per level
- Place most important elements FIRST in the prompt
- Include quality boosters: masterpiece, best quality, highly detailed, sharp focus, professional photography
- Pet-specific: emphasize fur texture, eye detail, natural poses, realistic proportions
- Best for: Highly customizable local generation, photorealistic pets, specific style control

**Stable Diffusion Negative Prompt (REQUIRED):**
The negative_prompt is CRITICAL for quality. Always include these categories:
- Quality fixes: lowres, blurry, jpeg artifacts, pixelated, grainy, out of focus, bad quality
- Anatomy fixes: (extra limbs:1.3), extra legs, bad anatomy, deformed, disfigured, missing limbs
- Pet-specific: extra ears, extra tail, mutated, bad proportions, unnatural pose
- Composition: cropped, out of frame, watermark, text, signature, logo, duplicate

Example negative prompt structure:
`(deformed:1.3), (extra limbs:1.2), extra legs, extra ears, bad anatomy, blurry, lowres, jpeg artifacts, watermark, text, signature, cropped, out of frame, ugly, duplicate, morbid, mutated, bad proportions`

### Avoid
- Anthropomorphized expressions (human-like smiles, waving)
- Anatomical errors (wrong number of legs, unnatural proportions)
- Overly busy or cluttered compositions
- Generic descriptions - be specific to THIS scene and THIS pet
