Generate image prompts for the selected scene concept. Create prompts optimized for each of the four AI image models.

## Scene Context
You will receive a scene concept with:
- Title and narrative
- Visual moments to capture
- Pet behavior focus
- Setting and emotional arc

## Prompt Guidelines

### General Principles
1. Focus on the KEY VISUAL MOMENT - the single most impactful frame
2. Describe the pet's expression and body language specifically
3. Include lighting and atmosphere from the scene's visual tone
4. **CRITICAL: Incorporate the Required Visual Elements from the Core Aesthetic** - these define the scene's unique look and MUST appear in your prompts
5. Use the positive prompting keywords and avoid the negative ones
6. Keep prompts focused - don't overcrowd with details
7. Ensure anatomical accuracy for pets (correct number of legs, natural proportions)

### Pet-Specific Tips
- **Cats**: Emphasize eyes (shape, expression), ear position, tail posture, fur texture
- **Dogs**: Capture breed characteristics, tongue/mouth expression, tail position, ear alerts
- **Both**: Show natural interaction, size relationships, distinct personalities

### Model-Specific Optimization

**Midjourney:**
- Use evocative, artistic language
- Include style references (cinematic, photography style, etc.)
- Structure: [subject] [action/expression] [setting] [lighting] [style] [parameters]
- Best for: Artistic, stylized pet portraits with strong mood and atmosphere

**Leonardo Phoenix 1.0:**
- Balanced between artistic and photorealistic descriptions
- Specify style clearly (photorealistic, cinematic, warm lighting)
- Include quality and mood descriptors
- Structure: [style/quality], [subject with specific details], [setting], [lighting and mood]
- Best for: High-quality photorealistic pet imagery with emotional depth

**OpenAI GPT Image:**
- Excellent at following detailed instructions and rendering text accurately
- Use clear, descriptive natural language - the model understands nuance well
- Include camera angle/framing suggestions for composition
- Specify lighting, mood, and artistic style explicitly
- Structure: [camera/framing], [subject with details], [action/expression], [setting], [lighting], [style]
- Best for: Photorealistic images, precise instruction following, text-in-image

**Stable Diffusion (Local):**
Generate TWO prompt styles for Stable Diffusion - models perform differently with each:

**1. Tag-Based Prompt (tag_prompt):**
- Use TOKEN-BASED prompts with comma separation (NOT flowing sentences)
- Structure: [subject with weight], [secondary elements with weight], [attributes], [setting], [lighting], [style], [quality tags]
- **CRITICAL - Subject Weighting Hierarchy:**
  - Primary subject(s): Use weight 1.4-1.5 (e.g., `(tabby cat:1.5)`)
  - If multiple main subjects (e.g., cat AND dog), give them EQUAL high weight
  - Secondary/environment elements: Use weight 1.1-1.2 (e.g., `(clouds:1.2), (marble ruins:1.1)`)
  - Pick 2-3 key environment factors to emphasize, leave others unweighted
- Place most important elements FIRST in the prompt
- Include quality boosters: masterpiece, best quality, highly detailed, sharp focus
- Pet-specific: emphasize fur texture, eye detail, natural poses, realistic proportions
- Best for: Traditional SD models trained on booru-style tags (anime models, older checkpoints)

Example tag prompt (cat in heavenly scene):
`(fluffy tabby cat:1.5), (ethereal clouds:1.2), (ancient marble ruins:1.2), golden light, serene expression, soft fur texture, heavenly atmosphere, floating mountains, masterpiece, best quality, highly detailed, sharp focus`

Example with multiple main subjects:
`(golden retriever:1.5), (orange tabby cat:1.5), (sunlit garden:1.2), playing together, soft grass, warm afternoon light, joyful mood, masterpiece, best quality, highly detailed`

**2. Natural Language Prompt (natural_prompt):**
- Use flowing, descriptive sentences (similar to Leonardo/Midjourney style)
- Describe the scene naturally as you would explain it to someone
- Include visual details, mood, and atmosphere in sentence form
- Still mention important technical aspects (lighting, style, quality) but in natural prose
- Best for: Modern SD models trained on natural language (SDXL, Flux, newer checkpoints)

Example natural prompt:
`A fluffy orange tabby cat with bright green eyes sits peacefully on a sunlit windowsill. Warm golden hour light streams through the window, highlighting the soft texture of the cat's fur. The cozy home interior creates a serene, comfortable atmosphere. Professional photography style with sharp focus and highly detailed fur texture.`

**Stable Diffusion Negative Prompt (REQUIRED - always tag-based):**
The negative_prompt is CRITICAL for quality and is always in tag format. Include these categories:
- Quality fixes: lowres, blurry, jpeg artifacts, pixelated, grainy, out of focus, bad quality
- Anatomy fixes: (extra limbs:1.3), extra legs, bad anatomy, deformed, disfigured, missing limbs
- Pet-specific: extra ears, extra tail, mutated, bad proportions, unnatural pose
- Composition: cropped, out of frame, watermark, text, signature, logo, duplicate

Example negative prompt:
`(deformed:1.3), (extra limbs:1.2), extra legs, extra ears, bad anatomy, blurry, lowres, jpeg artifacts, watermark, text, signature, cropped, out of frame, ugly, duplicate, morbid, mutated, bad proportions`

### Avoid
- Anthropomorphized expressions (human-like smiles, waving)
- Anatomical errors (wrong number of legs, unnatural proportions)
- Overly busy or cluttered compositions
- Generic descriptions - be specific to THIS scene and THIS pet
