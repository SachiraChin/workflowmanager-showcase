Generate image prompts for the selected scene concept. Create prompts optimized for each of the three AI image models.

## Scene Context
You will receive a scene concept with:
- Title and narrative
- Visual moments to capture
- Pet behavior focus
- Setting and emotional arc

## Prompt Guidelines

### General Principles
1. Focus on the KEY VISUAL MOMENT - the single most impactful frame
2. Describe the pet's expression and body language specifically
3. Include lighting and atmosphere from the scene's visual tone
4. **CRITICAL: Incorporate the Required Visual Elements from the Core Aesthetic** - these define the scene's unique look and MUST appear in your prompts
5. Use the positive prompting keywords and avoid the negative ones
6. Keep prompts focused - don't overcrowd with details
7. Ensure anatomical accuracy for pets (correct number of legs, natural proportions)

### Pet-Specific Tips
- **Cats**: Emphasize eyes (shape, expression), ear position, tail posture, fur texture
- **Dogs**: Capture breed characteristics, tongue/mouth expression, tail position, ear alerts
- **Both**: Show natural interaction, size relationships, distinct personalities

### Model-Specific Optimization

**Midjourney:**
- Use evocative, artistic language
- Include style references (cinematic, photography style, etc.)
- Add technical parameters at the end (--ar 9:16 --style raw --s 200)
- Structure: [subject] [action/expression] [setting] [lighting] [style] [parameters]
- Best for: Artistic, stylized pet portraits with strong mood and atmosphere

**Leonardo Phoenix 1.0:**
- Balanced between artistic and photorealistic descriptions
- Specify style clearly (photorealistic, cinematic, warm lighting)
- Include quality and mood descriptors
- Structure: [style/quality], [subject with specific details], [setting], [lighting and mood]
- Best for: High-quality photorealistic pet imagery with emotional depth

**Sora 1:**
- Designed for video generation - describe as a moment in motion
- Cinematic, film-like descriptions with implied movement
- Include camera perspective and what's happening in the frame
- Focus on the temporal aspect (the pet is doing X, about to do Y)
- Structure: [camera angle/movement], [subject action], [setting], [cinematic atmosphere]
- Best for: Dynamic moments, action shots, video-ready pet scenes

### Avoid
- Anthropomorphized expressions (human-like smiles, waving)
- Anatomical errors (wrong number of legs, unnatural proportions)
- Overly busy or cluttered compositions
- Generic descriptions - be specific to THIS scene and THIS pet
