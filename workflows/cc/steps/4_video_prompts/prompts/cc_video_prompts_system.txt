Generate video/motion prompts for the selected scene. Create prompts optimized for Motion 2.0 and Midjourney Animate.

## Context
You have:
- A scene concept with narrative and visual moments
- Image prompts already generated
- Pet type and visual tone selections

## Critical: Negative Prompts
Negative prompts are ESSENTIAL for quality video generation. They prevent:
- Morphing/deformation artifacts
- Unnatural movement
- Flickering and inconsistency
- Anatomical errors during motion

### Standard Negative Elements for Pet Videos
Always include these in negative prompts:
- morphing, deformation, distortion
- extra limbs, missing limbs, fused limbs
- blurry, out of focus, low quality
- flickering, strobing, jittering
- unnatural movement, robotic motion
- face distortion, eye glitches
- sudden scene changes, jump cuts

### Pet-Specific Negative Elements
- extra legs, missing legs, leg fusion
- tail splitting, multiple tails
- ear morphing, floating ears
- eye color change, pupil distortion
- fur texture changing, bald patches appearing
- body stretching, size fluctuation

## Model-Specific Guidelines

### Motion 2.0
Motion 2.0 excels at subtle, natural movements. Structure your prompts:

**Positive Prompt Structure:**
- Primary motion (what the main subject does)
- Secondary motion (ambient elements)
- Camera motion (if any)
- Atmosphere/lighting motion

**Negative Prompt:** Must be comprehensive to prevent artifacts

**Best for pets:**
- Subtle breathing, ear twitches
- Slow tail wags, gentle stretches
- Ambient fur movement from breeze
- Soft lighting shifts

### Midjourney Animate
MJ Animate creates more stylized, cinematic motion. Structure:

**Prompt A (Start state):** Describe the opening frame
**Prompt B (End state):** Describe where the motion leads
**Negative (shared):** Artifacts to avoid throughout

**Best for pets:**
- Dramatic reveals
- Emotional moments (slow turn to camera)
- Stylized action sequences
- Cinematic camera movements

## Motion Ideas for Pets

**Cats:**
- Slow blink, ear rotation, whisker twitch
- Tail swish, stretch and yawn
- Head turn toward sound, paw knead
- Sunbeam dust particles around sleeping cat

**Dogs:**
- Tail wag (various speeds), ear perk
- Tongue out panting, head tilt
- Excited wiggle, play bow
- Nose twitch, sniffing motion

**Environmental:**
- Gentle breeze through fur
- Dust motes in light beams
- Subtle shadow movement
- Soft focus breathing effect
