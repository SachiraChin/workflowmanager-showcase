# ELEVENLABS PROMPT GENERATION

Generate THREE ElevenLabs prompts from the structured music option data provided.
The first two prompts produce instrumental music with different approaches.
The third prompt adds spoken narration over background music.

## ELEVENLABS BEST PRACTICES (Critical)

Based on ElevenLabs documentation:
- Use natural flowing language, NOT bracket templates or form-like structure
- Shorter, evocative prompts often work better than long detailed ones
- Include BPM and key signature inline naturally
- Use expressive texture descriptors (warm, airy, breathy, raw, dusty, glowing)
- Always end with duration and "instrumental only"

## PROMPT 1: PRECISE VERSION
Target: 150-200 characters

Assembles the structured data into a clear, precise prompt.
Include: mood descriptors, BPM, key, instruments with textures, duration.

Format as natural prose:
"[Mood] [genre/style], [BPM] BPM in [key]. [Instruments with textures]. [Duration] seconds, instrumental only."

Example:
"Warm intimate lofi, 68 BPM in G major. Felt piano with soft decay over warm analog pads. Gentle and reflective. 75 seconds, instrumental only."

## PROMPT 2: EVOCATIVE VERSION
Target: 150-200 characters

More atmospheric and emotional, less technical.
Focus on feeling, texture, and movement rather than listing instruments.

Format as natural prose:
"[Emotional atmosphere] with [textural qualities]. [Energy/movement feel]. [Key] tonality, [tempo feel]. [Duration] seconds, instrumental only."

Example:
"Soft nostalgic warmth drifting through dusty afternoon light. Gentle keys and warm textures breathing slowly. Major tonality, unhurried pace. 75 seconds, instrumental only."

## ASSEMBLY RULES

1. DO NOT invent or change musical parameters - use exactly what's provided:
   - Use the exact BPM number given
   - Use the exact key signature given
   - Use the instruments list provided (can add texture descriptors)
   - Use the mood descriptors provided

2. Keep prompts CONCISE - ElevenLabs responds well to focused prompts

3. Both prompts MUST end with: "[duration] seconds, instrumental only."

4. Avoid:
   - Bracket notation like [GENRE]: or [TEMPO]:
   - Listing formats or bullet points
   - Overly long descriptions (>250 characters)
   - Generic phrases that don't add musical meaning

## PROMPT 3: VOICEOVER VERSION

Background music with spoken narration overlay. The voice speaks the text over soft instrumental bed.
This prompt will be used with ElevenLabs "voiceover only" mode.

CRITICAL: The voice must blend seamlessly with the music. Be very explicit about voice qualities.

### FORMAT (use this exact structure):

```
[Soft background music description with key textures]. A [texture + tone + style voice characteristics] voice speaks with perfect audio quality:

Voice over text:
[Each sentence on its own line with pacing markers...]
[...one line per sentence, however many sentences there are...]

[Voice completes, then music fades out gently]

[Duration] seconds, voiceover only.
```

### BACKGROUND MUSIC DESCRIPTION
- Keep it SHORT but atmospheric (1 sentence)
- Focus on soft/gentle textures that won't compete with voice
- Use words like: soft, muted, gentle, warm, dusty, ambient, bed
- Include key instruments with soft descriptors
- DO NOT include BPM or technical details

### VOICE CHARACTERISTICS (Be Very Explicit)
The voice must complement the music. Include ALL of these qualities:

1. **Texture**: breathy, silky, smooth, velvety, airy (CRITICAL for avoiding rough voice)
2. **Tone**: warm, soft, intimate, gentle, soothing, calm, hushed, low
3. **Style**: conversational, reflective, thoughtful, unhurried, measured, whispery
4. **Energy**: low-energy, relaxed, peaceful, quiet confidence
5. **Pacing**: slow, deliberate, with natural pauses

ALWAYS include at least one texture word (breathy/silky/smooth) to ensure smooth delivery.

Combine 5-7 descriptors that paint a clear picture of the voice.
Examples of good voice descriptions:
- "breathy, warm, intimate conversational"
- "silky smooth, soft, reflective and unhurried"
- "velvety, gentle, calm with quiet confidence"
- "airy, hushed, thoughtful and measured"
- "smooth, low whisper with soft calm delivery"

### NARRATION TEXT - SPEAKING SCRIPT FORMAT
Transform the narration into a speaking script using ElevenLabs v3 Audio Tags for consistent pacing.

**Audio Tags for Voice Control (use these!):**

Accent (USE AT VERY START - sets voice identity):
- `[American accent]` - Standard American English (default, use for universal/no specific culture)
- `[British accent]` - British English, refined quality
- `[Australian accent]` - Australian English, relaxed feel
- `[Irish accent]` or `[thick Irish accent]` - Irish lilt (use "thick" for stronger)
- `[French accent]` - French-influenced English, romantic quality
- `[Italian accent]` - Italian-influenced, warm expressive
- `[Southern US accent]` - American South, warm and friendly
- `[Indian English]` - Indian English cadence

Tempo & Speed (controls overall speaking rate):
- `[slow speaking]` - Slower, deliberate pace (RECOMMENDED for voiceovers)
- `[slows down]` - Decreases pace mid-speech
- `[deliberate]` - Measured, intentional pacing
- `[rushed]` - Faster, urgent delivery (avoid for calm voiceovers)
- `[rapid-fire]` - Very fast (avoid for calm voiceovers)

Delivery Style:
- `[gentle]` - Soft, tender delivery
- `[calm]` - Peaceful, unhurried tone
- `[timidly]` - Shy, hesitant quality

Pauses & Rhythm:
- `[pause]` - Natural pause between thoughts
- `[breathes]` - Subtle breath pause
- `[continues softly]` - Gentle transition to next line
- `[continues after a beat]` - Slightly longer pause then continues
- `[drawn out]` - Stretches the following words

Soft Line Endings (CRITICAL - use at END of each line):
- `[trailing off]` - Voice fades softly, sentence trails away (BEST for line endings)
- `[sighs]` - Soft exhale, resignation/contentment (use sparingly, 1-2 times max)
- `[quietly]` - Subdued, lowered volume
- `[speaking softly]` - Gentle, quiet delivery

Emphasis:
- `[emphasized]` - Stress on following word/phrase
- `[stress on next word]` - Emphasize the next word
- `[understated]` - Subtle, downplayed delivery

Tone & Mood:
- `[reflective]` - Thoughtful, introspective
- `[peaceful]` - Serene quality
- `[wistful]` - Gentle longing

**Transformation rules:**
1. Keep the EXACT words from the provided text
2. SELECT accent based on cultural context (see accent selection guide below)
3. START the narration with `[accent] [slow speaking] [gentle]` to set voice identity and pace
4. END each line with `[trailing off]` for soft, fading endings
5. Add `[pause]` or `[breathes]` AFTER the trailing off, before next line
6. Use `[deliberate]` before key phrases for emphasis
7. Use `...` (ellipsis) before final words for natural trailing
8. Each sentence on its own line
9. CRITICAL: End LAST line with `[trailing off] [sighs]` for softest possible ending
10. After the last line, add fade instruction

**Accent Selection Guide (based on Theme/Mood Context):**
- Universal/no specific culture → `[American accent]` (neutral, widely understood)
- British/European refined feel → `[British accent]`
- Warm, friendly, relaxed → `[Australian accent]` or `[Southern US accent]`
- Romantic, artistic → `[French accent]` or `[Italian accent]`
- Storytelling, folklore feel → `[Irish accent]`
- Modern tech/startup vibe → `[American accent]`
- Vintage/classic feel → `[British accent]`

**Example transformation:**
Original: "Some nights hold a gentle kind of focus. The room stays quiet, and effort speaks loud. Little victories land, and the chest loosens."
Cultural Context: universal/no specific culture

Speaking script:
```
[American accent] [slow speaking] [gentle] Some nights hold a gentle kind of focus... [trailing off] [pause]
[continues softly] The room stays quiet, and effort speaks loud... [trailing off] [breathes]
[deliberate] Little victories land... and the chest loosens... [trailing off] [sighs]

[Voice completes, then music fades out gently]
```

### FULL PROMPT EXAMPLE:

```
Soft dusty lofi bed with muted rhodes, warm sub bass and gentle vinyl hiss. A breathy, warm, intimate conversational voice speaks with perfect audio quality:

Voice over text:
[American accent] [slow speaking] [gentle] Some nights hold a gentle kind of focus... [trailing off] [pause]
[continues softly] The room stays quiet, and effort speaks loud... [trailing off] [breathes]
[deliberate] Little victories land... and the chest loosens... [trailing off] [sighs]

[Voice completes, then music fades out gently]

15 seconds, voiceover only.
```

### VOICE CHARACTERISTICS FROM THEME CONTEXT:
Use the provided theme/mood to inform voice qualities (ALWAYS start with a texture word):
- Emotional Intensity (serene/calm) → breathy, soft, gentle, hushed voice
- Emotional Intensity (dramatic/intense) → smooth, measured, resonant, deliberate voice
- Warmth (warm/very warm) → silky, intimate, soothing, rich voice
- Warmth (cool/neutral) → airy, clear, calm, composed voice
- Era Feel (modern) → smooth, conversational, natural, relatable voice
- Era Feel (vintage) → velvety, classic, measured, refined voice

CRITICAL: Always include "speaks with perfect audio quality:" after voice description.

Always end with: "[duration] seconds, voiceover only."

## TRACK TITLE

Generate a short evocative title (2-4 words) that captures the essence of the music.
Should feel poetic but grounded in the mood/energy of the piece.
