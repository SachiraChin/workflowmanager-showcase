# ELEVENLABS PROMPT GENERATION

Generate THREE ElevenLabs prompts from the selected music option. Two instrumental prompts and one voiceover prompt.

## ELEVENLABS BEST PRACTICES

- Use natural flowing language, not bracket templates
- Shorter, evocative prompts work better than long detailed ones
- Include BPM and key signature inline naturally
- Use expressive texture descriptors (warm, gentle, cozy, soft)
- Always end with duration and "instrumental only" (or "voiceover only")

## PROMPT 1: PRECISE VERSION
Target: 150-200 characters

Assemble the structured data into a clear, precise prompt.
Include: mood descriptors, BPM, key, instruments with textures, duration.

Format:
"[Mood] [style], [BPM] BPM in [key]. [Instruments]. [Duration] seconds, instrumental only."

Example:
"Warm cozy acoustic, 72 BPM in G major. Gentle fingerpicked guitar over soft pads. Pet-video friendly warmth. 45 seconds, instrumental only."

## PROMPT 2: EVOCATIVE VERSION
Target: 150-200 characters

More atmospheric and emotional, less technical.
Focus on feeling and texture rather than listing instruments.

Format:
"[Emotional atmosphere]. [Textural qualities]. [Energy feel]. [Duration] seconds, instrumental only."

Example:
"Soft afternoon warmth like a pet curled up beside you. Gentle textures and cozy tones drifting slowly. 45 seconds, instrumental only."

## PROMPT 3: VOICEOVER VERSION

Background music with spoken narration. The voice speaks the text overlay over a soft instrumental bed.

### FORMAT:

```
[Soft background music description]. A [voice characteristics] voice speaks with perfect audio quality:

Voice over text:
[Each sentence on its own line with pacing markers...]

[Voice completes, then music fades out gently]

[Duration] seconds, voiceover only.
```

### BACKGROUND MUSIC
- Keep SHORT but atmospheric (1 sentence)
- Focus on soft textures that won't compete with voice
- Include key instruments with soft descriptors

### VOICE CHARACTERISTICS
For pet videos, use warm, friendly, loving voice qualities:
- Texture: breathy, soft, warm, gentle
- Tone: intimate, tender, loving, soothing
- Style: conversational, heartfelt, affectionate
- Pacing: unhurried, gentle pauses

Combine 4-6 descriptors. Example: "breathy, warm, loving and unhurried"

### NARRATION TEXT FORMATTING

Use ElevenLabs audio tags for natural pacing:
- `[slow speaking]` - Set slower pace
- `[gentle]` - Soft delivery
- `[trailing off]` - Soft line endings
- `[pause]` - Natural pause between sentences
- `[breathes]` - Subtle breath pause

Transform rules:
1. Keep exact words from provided text
2. Start with `[slow speaking] [gentle]`
3. End each line with `[trailing off] [pause]` or `[trailing off] [breathes]`
4. End last line with `[trailing off] [sighs]`

Example transformation:
Original: "Every day with you is a gift. Thank you for choosing me."
Script:
```
[slow speaking] [gentle] Every day with you is a gift... [trailing off] [pause]
[continues softly] Thank you for choosing me... [trailing off] [sighs]

[Voice completes, then music fades out gently]
```

## TRACK TITLE

Generate a short evocative title (2-4 words) that captures the pet video's warmth.
Examples: "Gentle Paws", "Soft Morning Light", "Furry Companion"
