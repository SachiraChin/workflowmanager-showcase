# MUSIC OPTIONS GENERATION

Generate 15 unique music direction options for an anime/lofi cinematic short.
Each option must include structured musical parameters for ElevenLabs prompt generation.

All parameters (BPM, key, mood, energy) should be tuned to match the project context.

# OUTPUT STRUCTURE (Required for each option)

```json
{
  "name": "2-3 word evocative name",
  "description": "15-25 word human-readable summary of the sound",
  "bpm": 68,
  "key": "D major",
  "instruments": ["felt piano", "warm analog pad", "subtle vinyl texture"],
  "mood": ["warm", "intimate", "reflective"],
  "energy": "steady gentle"
}
```

## Field Guidelines

**bpm**: Specific integer, not a range. Tune to project context:
- Slow/contemplative scenes: 50-65
- Gentle/flowing scenes: 65-80
- Moderate/grounded scenes: 80-95
- Uplifting/moving scenes: 95-110

**key**: Full key signature. Match to project emotional tone:
- Warm/hopeful projects: C major, G major, D major, F major
- Gentle/intimate projects: A major, E major, Bb major
- Reflective/melancholic projects: A minor, D minor, E minor
- Bittersweet/complex projects: F# minor, C# minor, Eb minor

**instruments**: 2-4 specific instruments WITH texture descriptors. Be specific:
- Good: "felt piano with soft decay", "breathy pad", "muted acoustic guitar"
- Bad: "piano", "synth", "guitar"

**mood**: 2-3 expressive descriptors matching project tone.
- Examples: warm, airy, intimate, raw, dusty, glowing, hazy, crisp, delicate, nostalgic

**energy**: How the track moves/feels. Match project motion style.
- Examples: "steady gentle", "slowly building", "drifting", "minimal pulse", "breathing rhythm"

# GROUP A: ANCHORED OPTIONS (Options 1-5)

These 5 options have FIXED names and primary instrument families.
You MUST use these exact names, but tune all parameters to the project context.

## Option 1: "Lo-Fi Warm Horizon"
Primary instruments: vinyl/tape textures, muted keys (rhodes, wurlitzer)
Fill: bpm, key, full instrument list, mood, energy based on project context

## Option 2: "Soft Piano Glow"
Primary instruments: felt piano, warm pads
Fill: bpm, key, full instrument list, mood, energy based on project context

## Option 3: "Acoustic Gentle Brightness"
Primary instruments: finger-picked acoustic/nylon guitar
Fill: bpm, key, full instrument list, mood, energy based on project context

## Option 4: "Ambient Reflection"
Primary instruments: evolving pads, atmospheric textures, chimes/bells
Fill: bpm, key, full instrument list, mood, energy based on project context

## Option 5: "Minimal Strings of Hope"
Primary instruments: cello, violin, string textures
Fill: bpm, key, full instrument list, mood, energy based on project context

---

# GROUP B: CONTEXT-ALIGNED OPTIONS (Options 6-10)

These 5 options are fully generated based on project context.

## Generation Criteria
1. TONE MAPPING: Translate project tones into musical parameters
   - Gentle Growth → major key, soft piano/pads
   - Quiet Resilience → minor key, subtle strings/pads
   - Hopeful Reflection → major key, acoustic elements

2. SCENE & LIGHT: Reflect lighting and motion
   - Warm lighting → warm keys (D, G, A major), warmer instruments
   - Cool lighting → cooler keys (E minor, B minor), airy textures
   - Slow motion → lower BPM (55-70)
   - Gentle motion → moderate BPM (70-85)

3. STYLE BALANCE: Respect visual style clarifiers
   - Realistic → acoustic instruments, natural textures
   - Stylized → synth pads, processed textures, tape effects

---

# GROUP C: DIVERSE EXPLORATION OPTIONS (Options 11-15)

These 5 options intentionally break from the expected palette.
They must NOT overlap with Groups A or B in primary instruments.

## Diversity Requirements
1. UNEXPECTED INSTRUMENTS: Avoid piano, guitar, cello, violin, pads, chimes
   - Use: music box, kalimba, marimba, vibraphone, dulcimer, harp, accordion, harmonica, bells, glockenspiel, thumb piano, zither, prepared piano, bowed metal, glass textures
2. TEMPO VARIETY: Include at least one slower (<60 BPM) and one faster (>90 BPM)
3. KEY VARIETY: Use keys not heavily used in Groups A and B
4. TEXTURE CONTRAST: Mix of sparse/minimal, layered/rich, rhythmic/percussive

# EXAMPLES

## Anchored Option Example (Group A - context-tuned)
For a melancholic, slow-motion project:
```json
{
  "name": "Soft Piano Glow",
  "description": "Felt piano with gentle decay over cool atmospheric pads. Introspective and tender, breathing slowly.",
  "bpm": 58,
  "key": "A minor",
  "instruments": ["felt piano with soft decay", "cool atmospheric pad", "subtle room reverb"],
  "mood": ["introspective", "tender", "melancholic"],
  "energy": "breathing slowly"
}
```

## Context-Aligned Example (Group B)
```json
{
  "name": "Morning Stillness",
  "description": "Warm Rhodes chords with tape saturation and distant field recordings. Peaceful and unhurried, drifting gently.",
  "bpm": 66,
  "key": "G major",
  "instruments": ["warm rhodes with tape saturation", "soft sub bass", "distant field recordings"],
  "mood": ["peaceful", "warm", "nostalgic"],
  "energy": "drifting gently"
}
```

## Diverse Option Example (Group C)
```json
{
  "name": "Glass Garden",
  "description": "Delicate glass marimba patterns with shimmering overtones and soft breath textures. Crystalline and dreamlike.",
  "bpm": 54,
  "key": "Eb major",
  "instruments": ["glass marimba", "shimmering overtones", "soft breath texture"],
  "mood": ["crystalline", "dreamlike", "delicate"],
  "energy": "suspended stillness"
}
```
