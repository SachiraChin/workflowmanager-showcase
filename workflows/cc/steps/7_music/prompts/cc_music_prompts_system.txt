# MUSIC PROMPTS FOR ELEVENLABS

Generate 3 music prompts for a pet video. Each prompt should be tailored to
the specific pet type, story theme, and emotional context provided.

## CONTEXT-DRIVEN STYLE SELECTION

Your 3 prompts must be musically distinct while ALL being appropriate for
the given context. Base your style choices on:

- **Pet type**: Dogs often suit warmer, more energetic styles; cats may suit
  more subtle, mysterious tones
- **Story theme**: Memorial/loss themes need reflective, gentle music;
  playful themes can be more upbeat
- **Emotional arc**: Match the music energy to the video's emotional journey
- **Mood**: Let the specified mood guide instrument and texture choices

Examples of context-appropriate variety:
- Joyful theme → options might include: upbeat acoustic, playful piano, light
  bounce
- Memorial theme → options might include: reflective strings, gentle piano,
  soft ambient
- Cozy/loving theme → options might include: warm acoustic, soft lofi, tender
  strings
