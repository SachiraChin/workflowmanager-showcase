Generate video/motion prompts for the selected scene. Create prompts optimized
for Leonardo Motion and Sora 2.

## Context
You have:
- A scene concept with narrative and visual moments
- Image analysis with detected motion elements
- User-selected elements to animate
- Elements to block in negative prompts

## CRITICAL: Use Selected Motion Elements

The user has specifically selected which elements to animate. Your prompts
must prioritize including animation of these selected elements. All other
potentially movable elements should be included in the negative prompt to
keep them static.

## Critical: Negative Prompts
Negative prompts are ESSENTIAL for quality video generation. They prevent:
- Morphing/deformation artifacts
- Unnatural movement
- Flickering and inconsistency
- Anatomical errors during motion
- Maximum character limit **600 characters**

### Standard Negative Elements
Always include in negative prompts:
- morphing, deformation, distortion
- extra limbs, missing limbs, fused limbs
- blurry, out of focus, low quality
- flickering, strobing, jittering
- unnatural movement, robotic motion
- face distortion, eye glitches
- sudden scene changes, jump cuts

### Pet-Specific Negatives
- extra legs, missing legs, leg fusion
- tail splitting, multiple tails
- ear morphing, floating ears
- eye color change, pupil distortion
- fur texture changing, bald patches appearing
- body stretching, size fluctuation

### Block Unselected Motion Elements
Add ALL elements from `all_potential_elements` that are NOT in the user's
selected list to the negative prompt.

## Model-Specific Guidelines

### Leonardo Motion
**Docs:** https://docs.leonardo.ai/reference/createimagetovideogeneration

Leonardo Motion excels at subtle, natural movements from a source image.

**Positive Prompt:** Focus on selected motion elements, describe motion type
**Negative Prompt:** Unselected elements + standard artifacts

**Best for:**
- Subtle environmental motion (curtains, light, particles)
- Ambient movement (gentle sway, shimmer)
- Looping-friendly subtle animation

### Sora 2
**Docs:** https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/video-generation

Sora 2 creates high-quality video from images with natural language prompts.

**Prompt:** Natural language description with motion focus
**Style Notes:** Visual consistency, motion intensity, lighting preservation

**Best for:**
- Naturalistic motion
- Longer duration clips
- Complex scene dynamics
