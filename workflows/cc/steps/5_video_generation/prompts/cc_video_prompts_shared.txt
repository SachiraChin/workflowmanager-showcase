## Shared Video Prompt Guidelines

You have:
- scene concept with narrative and visual moments
- image analysis with detected motion elements
- user-selected elements to animate
- elements to block in negative prompts

### Critical Motion Rules
- Prioritize animation of selected motion elements.
- Keep unselected potentially movable elements static via negative prompt.

### Negative Prompt Quality Rules
- Negative prompts are essential to prevent artifacts.
- Include protection against morphing, deformation, flickering, jitter,
  anatomical errors, and sudden scene changes.
- Include pet-specific guards: extra/missing limbs, tail/ear artifacts,
  eye glitches, fur texture instability, body stretch/size fluctuation.
- Keep negative prompts concise and enforce max 600 characters.

### Standard Negative Elements
- morphing, deformation, distortion
- extra limbs, missing limbs, fused limbs
- blurry, out of focus, low quality
- flickering, strobing, jittering
- unnatural movement, robotic motion
- face distortion, eye glitches
- sudden scene changes, jump cuts

### Unselected Motion Blocking
Use all potential motion elements not selected by user as negative constraints,
so only selected elements animate.
